# KMeans_Algorithm_Calculation
This project explains the steps the k means algorithm uses to form the clusters and how it can be used for calculation of location with high sales in Walmart.

Steps:
1)Initially 2  centroids are assigned randomly. 
2)The Euclidian distance is used to find out which centroid is closet to each data point and the data points are assigned to the corresponding centroids.
3)Determine the centre points for the data points of the cluster. And compare with the centroids and repeat the same process with other data points.
4)The process is iteratively repeated until our centroids become static.
